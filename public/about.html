<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Nour, a dynamic individual who thrives on challenges and competetion. When not studying computer engineering, I can often be found exploring the different books, walking 10K steps, or learning more about web development. A passionate learner, I love capturing new information and sharing it with friends and family. In the evenings, I enjoy learning more about religion and discovering new aspects about space. With a keen interest in technology and a love for learning, I embody a perfect blend of the modern and the timeless.I hope to one day achieve my goal of becoming the best computer engineer this world has ever seen.</p>
